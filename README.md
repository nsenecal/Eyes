# Pyes (pronounced "pies")
 A light eyeball widget that follows the mouse.

# Execution

Windows: Download Pyes.exe and run

Linux: TBD

MacOS: Probably never

# Testing 

(Assuming Python is already installed)
Download source, extract to a folder and run Pyes.py

# Known issues

If your screen scale (found under display settings) is not exactly 100% you will not be able to properly move the Pyes widget. There is no known solution as python cannot read that kind of system data.
